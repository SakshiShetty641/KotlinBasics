Kotlin Basics

Expressions versus Statements
-An expression is a piece of code that produces a value. 
In other words, an expression evaluates to a single value.

-A statement is a complete instruction that directs the computer to perform a specific action. 
Statements are typically composed of expressions and control structures (like loops and conditionals). 
Unlike expressions, statements do not produce values directly.
