Kotlin Basics

Expressions versus Statements
-An expression is a piece of code that produces a value. 
In other words, an expression evaluates to a single value. 


-A statement is a complete instruction that directs the computer to perform a specific action. 
Statements are typically composed of expressions and control structures (like loops and conditionals). 
Unlike expressions, statements do not produce values directly. 

#Main Function
In Kotlin, the main function serves as the entry point for a Kotlin application
This is because when the Kotlin runtime starts, it looks for a main function at the top level to start executing 
the application. If the main function is inside a class, it won't be recognized as the entry point.
